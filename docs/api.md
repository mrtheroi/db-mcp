# API

HTTP endpoints and MCP tools served by memry-server. Production host: `https://api.memry.com.mx`. See [Security](security.md) for authentication and rate limit details.

## MCP tools

Served at `POST /mcp/memory` (Sanctum bearer token). Agents discover the tools with `tools/list` and invoke them with `tools/call`.

Project names are normalized on write and on query (trimmed, lowercased, repeated `--`/`__` collapsed), so `dbmcp`, `dbMcp` and ` DbMcp ` refer to the same project.

| Tool | Arguments (* required) | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `save-memory` | `session_id`*, `type`*, `title`*, `content`*, `project`, `topic_key` | Saves an observation. The same `topic_key` in the same project (under any spelling) updates it instead of duplicating it. |
| `search-memory` | `query`*, `limit` (1–20, default 10), `project` | Full-text search (title weighs more than content), ordered by relevance. Pass `project` to search only that project; omit it to search all projects. |
| `session-summary` | `session_id`*, `project`*, `content`*, `repo` | Saves the session summary as an observation of type `session_summary`. Pass `repo` when the project spans several repositories; the title becomes `Session summary: {project} ({repo})`. |
| `get-context` | `project`* | Returns a bounded context of the project: the last 3 session summaries (the newest in full, the other two with their date and a 300-character preview), up to 20 topic-key memories with a 300-character preview, and up to 10 other recent memories by title. |
| `get-memory` | `id`* | Returns the full content of one of the user's own memories. An id that does not exist or belongs to another user returns `Memory not found.` |
| `save-prompt` | `session_id`*, `content`*, `project` | Stores the user's prompt verbatim. |

## HTTP context endpoint

`GET /api/context?project={name}` returns exactly the text of `get-context` as `text/plain`, so shell hooks (e.g. a Claude Code `SessionStart` hook) can load the project context without speaking MCP JSON-RPC. It uses the same Sanctum bearer tokens and the same rate limit as MCP requests.

```bash
curl -sf -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  "https://<your-host>/api/context?project=dbmcp"
```

| Status | When |
| --- | --- |
| `200` | The context, or `No context found for project {project}.` |
| `401` | Missing or invalid token |
| `422` | `project` missing, not a string, or longer than 255 characters |
| `429` | Rate limit exceeded |

## Terminal login

The `memry` CLI logs in without a browser: request a one-time code by email, then exchange it for a Sanctum token. Signup is open: an unknown email creates the user on its first successful login.

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://<your-host>/api/auth/code \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email":"ada@example.com"}'
# 202 {"message":"If the email is valid, a login code has been sent."}

curl -s -X POST https://<your-host>/api/auth/token \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email":"ada@example.com","code":"042917"}'
# 200 {"token":"1|..."}

curl -s -X DELETE https://<your-host>/api/auth/token -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
# 204 (only this token is revoked)
```

The email is trimmed and lowercased. The code has 6 digits, expires in 5 minutes, works once, and is replaced by any newer code for the same email. The token is named `memry-cli` and works for `/mcp/memory` and `/api/context`.

| Endpoint | Status | When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST /api/auth/code` | `202` | Always for a valid email (same answer whether or not the user exists) |
| | `422` | `email` missing, not a string, not an email, or longer than 255 characters |
| | `429` | Rate limit exceeded for the email or the IP (see [Security](security.md#rate-limits)) |
| `POST /api/auth/token` | `200` | `{"token": "..."}` |
| | `422` | Validation errors, or `Invalid or expired code.` (wrong, expired, used or superseded code; the 5th wrong attempt burns the code) |
| | `429` | Rate limit exceeded for the IP (see [Security](security.md#rate-limits)) |
| `DELETE /api/auth/token` | `204` | The token used for the request is revoked; the user's other tokens stay valid |
| | `401` | Missing, invalid or already revoked token |

## Account deletion

`DELETE /api/account` deletes the authenticated user and all of their data: memories, prompts, every token (not only the one used for the request) and pending login codes. The body must repeat the account email, so a stray call cannot delete the account. The email is trimmed and lowercased, as in the login endpoints. It shares the rate limit of `/mcp/memory` and `/api/context`.

```bash
curl -s -X DELETE https://<your-host>/api/account \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email":"ada@example.com"}'
# 204
```

| Status | When |
| --- | --- |
| `204` | The account and all of its data are deleted |
| `401` | Missing or invalid token |
| `422` | `email` missing, not a string, or not the email of the account |
| `429` | Rate limit exceeded |
